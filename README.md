# Enigma
A working simulation of the Engima cipher machine, implemented in Python.

## About the Enigma Machine

The Enigma machine was an electro-mechanical encryption device used by Germany during World War II.
Messages were scrambled through a series of rotating rotors, a plugboard, and a reflector, making the cipher incredibly complex. 

The brilliance (and flaw) of Enigma is that it's self-reversible -- encryption and decryption are the same operation when the same settings are used. This means if you encrypt a message twice with the identical settings, you get the original text back.

## TypeX
Type X is the British version of the Engima machine. It consisted of 5 rotors instead of 3 rotors running, and used single-ended plugboard, which did not restrict the machine from letter pairs.
